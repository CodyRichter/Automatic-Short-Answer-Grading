# Automated Short Answer Grading

## Overview

This repository contains all of the notebooks for the team's Compsci-685 project. Each sub-folder corresponds to a major aspect of the paper, with the headers of the paper lining up with the folder names.

Additionally, all of the work the team did but was not included in the final paper is in the "Old Notebooks" folder for reference.
